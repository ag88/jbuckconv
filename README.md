# [Buck converter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_converter) simulator
---

This is a Buck converter simulator for java.
The simulation is generated by directly integrating the simplified Buck Converter
ODE (ordinary differential equation).

![example](web/screen.png "example")


## Build

In linux/osx/un*x:
```
mvnw clean package
```
in windows:
```
mvnw.cmd clean package
```
The built jar file is in the target folder. 
Note there are dependencies to libraries in the libs folder. 
If you want to run it independently, in the target folder,
preserve the generated jar file and its libs subdirectory jar files and structure.
This set is needed to run without errors. e.g.
```
jbuckconv-0.1.0.jar
libs/commons-math3-3.6.1.jar
libs/jfreechart-1.5.3.jar
libs/log4j-api-2.17.2.jar
libs/log4j-core-2.17.2.jar
```

## Run

In the target folder run the generated  jbuckconv-*.jar, e.g.
```
java -jar jbuckconv-0.1.0.jar
```
You might be able to simply double click the jar file to run it. 

## Pre-requisites

This requires Java 11 to build and/or run.

## Notes / limitations

There is no assurance if the ODE or that integration (simulation) is after all correct. 
It basically runs the idealized (currently only on state) ODE through the Runge Kutta integrator,
The ODE derivations is in the doc folder [buck_eqn.pdf](doc/buck_eqn.pdf). One should verify them, e.g. review derivations and codes, compare with other apps results, etc and not simply trust the results for design purposes. It is also idealised and the diode, switching transistors, internal resistances (inductor, capacitor etc) in a typical buck converter circuit are not taken into account.

In addition, timesteps matter.  The integration timesteps should be at least 10x smaller (or much smaller) than the buck converter PWM period. If the integration timesteps is too large, there can be large oscillations that produce incorrect results.

If you use the 'debug' features, selectable on the menu. It prints the values while the computing them, it is very verbose, so it is turned off default. Those messages goes on the console. So if there is no console (command prompt) window, you would likely need to run it on the command line using that java -jar jbuckconv-0.1.0.jar command above.
